## GitHub Actions Testing 

### Shiny App Deployment

Following these instructions to test using GitHub Actions to deploy updates to a Shiny web application:
https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/examples#shiny-app-deployment

The deployed app is here:  https://daltare.shinyapps.io/test-app/

This automatically deploys changes to this Shiny app whenever changes to the `app.R` file are pushed to this repository (i.e., not deploying from RStudio). This should ensure that the code shown here always matches what's shown in the deployed app.
